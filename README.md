# Customer-Mangement-App
I've been digging deep into python of late and also exploring the django framework for web development.
Django is a beautiful framework in terms of it's simplicity, ease of use and the fact that it allows to build apps at scale.
The App enables users to create an account and make orders.
The system handles the entire process.
This is still being developed though, for the fun of learning.
Ives helped a lot with his learning material.
